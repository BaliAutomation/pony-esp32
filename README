This repository will allow you compile pony programs using the esp-idf environment.

To install, simply execute the "install.sh" script. This script will do the following:

1) Modify the esp-idf makefiles to take into account pony source files. 
   This include files that have ".pony" extension. The modification are 
   extracted from helpers/makefile.patch

2) Install ponyc.sh into "/usr/local/bin/"
   This executable is responsible of converting pony source files into
   objects.

Note: This is a highly experimental repository.
