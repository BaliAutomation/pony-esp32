This repository will allow you compile pony programs using the esp-idf environment.

The esp-idf environment must already be installed. The "$IDF_PATH" must already be set.
Additionally some of the existing tools use docker. So it needs to be installed.

To install, simply execute the "install.sh" script. This script will do the following:

1) Modify the esp-idf makefiles to take into account pony source files. 
   This include files that have ".pony" extension. The modification are 
   extracted from helpers/makefile.patch

2) Install ponyc.sh into "/usr/local/bin/"
   This executable is responsible of converting pony source files into
   objects. To do this the current script uses 2 docker containers.

Note: This is a highly experimental repository.
